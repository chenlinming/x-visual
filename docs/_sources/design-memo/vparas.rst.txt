Visual.paras
============

.. _visual-paras:

Visual.paras has different usage for different vtype. See :ref:`visual-renderer`
for general information about Visual component.

Shared for different vtype
--------------------------

- tex_alpha

Range 0 ~ 1, for any object's material accepting alpha channel (Three.js Object3D.opacity).

- uniforms

These parameters are merged into THREE.Material's uniforms property.

- asset

Texture path, or uri.

X-visual can handle data of MIME type of::

    application/x-visual+img

with data can only be::

   grey-pixel

which will generate a cheap texture with only one pixel of grey color. It can be
useful for debugging or create a default material.

paras only for ShaderFlag enabled
---------------------------------

X-visual extended some shaders for special visual effects. The following parameters
can be meaningful only for these shaders.

- paras.u_tex

A string pointing to file in 'asset' folder. If the is not undefined, the vtype's
flag, ShaderFlag.defaultex is ignored.

u_tex is a shader's uniforms parameter, which means only Visual using THREE.ShaderMaterial
can has a u_tex parameter.

After v0.3, *u_tex* is an array for shader of ShaderFlag = colorArray. The array
can be morphed using u_morph<i> in ModelSeqs.script.

- paras.colors

An array of color (0 ~ 1) to used by morphing handling.

.. _visual-paras-color-array:

paras only for shader = colorArray
----------------------------------

Shader *colorArray* is a phone material shader supporting color morphing and texture
morphing.

Currently it's ambient, diffuse & specular parameter are constant 1.0. But it can
accepting an array of colors and an array of textures, can can be morphed with
ModelSeqs.script.paras.u_morph<i>.

test::

    test/html/morph-color.html
    test/html/morph-event.html

In addition to *u_tex* & *colors*, the shader also needs paramets of texture weight
and texture mixing mode.

- paras.texMix

This parameter is type of `xv.XComponent.ShaderAlpha <https://odys-z.github.io/javadoc/x-visual/XComponent.html>`_.

X-visual only support two of texture mixing / blending mode from Three.js, normal
and multiply.

The following example is modified from Three.js examples, with a PNG file added.

.. image:: imgs/005-three.js-blending.png
    :width: 720px

But as texture mix morphing introduced, it's not usable. X-visual is trying to
implement some of these with shader.

See :ref:`test: texture & color morphing<tex-color-morph>`.

See also `Three.js example: material blending <https://threejs.org/examples/?q=blending#webgl_materials_blending>`_.

paras only for vtype = point or refPoint
----------------------------------------

It's been used for vtype = :ref:`AssetType.refPoint<vtype-refPoint>` or
:ref:`AssetType.point<vtype-point>`.

For these vtype, it's usually used together with :ref:`animtype-u-morphi`
and :ref:`animtype-uniform`.

Check it for how Visual.paras and ModelSeqs.script.paras work together to change
glsl/shaders behaviour.

If the Visual.asset specified a gltf asset, the gltf mesh will be converted into
visible points, as particles (e.g. the vertices are tweened with uniforms).

If the Visual.asset parameter is null or undefined, the Obj3.mesh will be created
by Thrender using this entity.Visual.paras.obj3type, which can be one of geometry
type of :ref:`XComponent <api-xcomponents>` value.

- paras.nodes

This parameter used only for creating mesh from gltf assets. It's a string array
of node's name in gltf. Model of these nodes will be converted into points.

- paras.paths

This parameter used only for creating mesh from svg assets. It's a string array
of path names in svg.

-- For AssetType.refPoint

TODO test case as example.

-- For AssetType.voxel

A `Voxel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel>`_ is handled in x-visual as a single
WebGl point.

- paras.noise

If true, the generated Object3D object will have a 'a_noise' attribute. For animation
type :ref:`AnimType.U_MORPHi <animtype-u-morphi>` and :ref:`AnimType UNIFORM<animtype-uniform>`,
this value is used for scale the distance.

** Not implemented **

- paras.vert_scale

A **string** for vertex size scale. Here is how the default particles vertex shader
handling this parameter.

.. code-block:: javascript

    gl_PointSize = size * `${paras.vert_scale || '10.0'}`;
..
