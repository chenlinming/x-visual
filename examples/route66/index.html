	<p>Issues:
		<ol><li><a href='https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/161061/text-not-being-exported-to-gltf'>
				Text in blender won't been exported as GLTF meshes</a><br>
				This means blender can't export all it's resource into GLTF.
				And text objects in blender won't been loaded.
			</li>
			<li><a href='https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/12956'>
				Node's names are <i>sanitized</i></a><br>
				In three.module.js:<pre>
	/**
	 * Replaces spaces with underscores and removes unsupported characters from
	 * node names, to ensure compatibility with parseTrackName().
	 *
	 * @param {string} name Node name to be sanitized.
	 * @return {string}
	 */
	sanitizeNodeName: function ( name ) {
		return name.replace( /\s/g, '_' ).replace( _reservedRe, '' );
	},</pre>This means node names like "route66 panel" can only been usable with
			name "route66_panel" - x-visual also have to "sanitize" it.
